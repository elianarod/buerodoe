              In a scenario where a significant disconnect exists between humans
              and nature, misunderstandings and misrepresentations may emerge.
              To bridge this gap, a machine was used as a mediator, merging two
              distinct datasets — typefaces from the Google Fonts Library and
              images of slime mold simulations. Through this process, an AI was
              trained to produce unrecognizable and new letters, revealing
              hidden elements in the latent space between humans and nature. Its
              visual performance is a result of curating, categorizing and
              sorting, offering the viewers new perceptions and reflections on
              the shapes of letters, emphasizing form and composition over
              readability.

              An orientation system developed for the cultural center
              4lthangrund in Vienna supports a vibrant collective space that
              hosts around 200 events each year. Spanning over 1800 m², the
              venue includes a gallery, food cooperative, garden, club room, and
              offices, serving as a base for more than 40 groups and
              initiatives. Conceived within an open collective, the design
              encourages participation and invites visitors to actively shape
              and navigate the shared environment.

            <div class="desc">
              HTML has proven to be stable and reliable over the years, forming
              the backbone of the World Wide Web. Reflecting on HTML’s timeless,
              reliable and accessible qualities, a collectively built website
              archives the things people want to preserve for the future.
              Exploring topics on preserving, archiving and accessibility, this
              approach tries to outline the ephemerality of digitally stored
              materials. Collective destruction is the way to gain access to
              content that is inherently impermanent.

              A series of posters explores post-humanist design strategies and
              visual languages for non-human creators. Drawing on tentacular
              thinking and the concept of the Chthulucene, the work intertwines
              ecological, philosophical, and speculative references to question
              human-centered perspectives.

            <div class="desc">
              In collaboration with Lucile Olympe Haute, this project explores
              technological emancipation through the creation of a web-to-print
              zine. Designed entirely with HTML and CSS and exported as a PDF
              from the browser, the work embodies the principles of the
              Cyberwitches Manifesto, calling for the fusion of spirituality,
              technical autonomy, and ecological awareness.
